# Disseration Project
This project was the code completed as part of my course disseration, which was titled "Impact of Exposure to Virtual Environment Recreation on Familiarity
and Confidence".

This project involved recreating the Edge Theatre at the University of Bath and allowing users to explore the environment.
This exploration was done through a choreography routine to allow them to familiarise themselves with the environment.

The MetaQuest VR Headset was integrated into the Unity environment to allow for easy and realistic exploration of the environment.
All of the objects within the environment were modelled in Blender, and were done to the scale of the theatre to maximise the familiarity that could be obtained in this environment.
